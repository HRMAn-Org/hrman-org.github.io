###Installing KNIME and loading the HRMAn workflow
[![Installing HRMAn](img/thumb_installation.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCf17RR0yBA "Installing HRMAn")
    
    

KNIME is an open source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through a modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing, for modeling and data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming.
    
KNIME can be downloaded [__here__](https://www.knime.com/downloads).
If you want to learn more about KNIME, you can check their [__homepage__](https://www.knime.com/). It also includes a [__forum__](https://www.knime.com/forum) which can be useful if you should encouter any issues with it.

The video above shows you how to install KNIME and extensions needed to run HRMAn on your computer. After you have completed the steps you should be able to execute HRMAn and analyse your imaging data. 
The next video will provide you with a hands-on demo on how to use HRMAn.
    
###Using HRMAn
[![Running HRMAn](img/thumb_HRMAN.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnwYZsx4kn4/ "Running HRMAn")
    

This video will guide you through your first image analysis with HRMAn. Please refer to the other videos to find more information on how to set up KNIME and how to prepare the training datasets. If you want to run the analysis on your computer you can download the example data [here](https://bitbucket.org/hrman/hrman-src/raw/67c1e521090492ecfe447dfda4d9f550c62ccd48/Tutorial_data.zip).

###Pre-processing of microscope images
[![Microscope Image pre-processing for HRMAn](img/thumb_pre-process.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBuAlTruYGk "Microscope Image pre-processing for HRMAn")

    
The video will explain to you how to pre-process your images if they were not imaged on a high content imaging microscope. You can use any microscope that is available to you and use this KNIME pipeline to re-name your images so that they can be clustered appropriately. The KNIME workflow can be downloaded [here](downloads.html).

###KNIME deep learning for HRMAn
[![KNIME deep learning for HRMAn](img/thumb_deep-learning.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak1JIYIcbIg "KNIME deep learning for HRMAn")

    
This video will show you how to set up DL4J in KNIME and how to use it to train the AlexNet deep convolution network. Once you have trained your network foryour pathogen and staining, you can save it and use it in the HRMAn pipeline to analyse your images.
    
###Creating your own learning dataset for machine-learning based prediction of pathogens per vacuole
[![Learning dataset creation for HRMAn](img/thumb_learning_dataset.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vt0JaAwTXU "Learning dataset creation for HRMAn")


In order to run HRMAn with your prefered pathogen and to do prediction of pathogens per vacuole/cluster you will need to create a reliable dataset for the machine learning algorithm integrated into HRMAn. This workflow will crop the images for you and prepare the spreadsheet file, so that only one column containing the value to predict has to be filled in based on the cropped images. The video will show you how to do this. The workflow can be downloaded [here](downloads.html).
