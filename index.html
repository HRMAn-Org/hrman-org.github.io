### HRMAn, soon fork us on on [GitHub](http://github.com/)

###[__Home__](index.html) : [__Sample data__](sample_data.html) : [__Downloads__](downloads.html) : [__Tutorials__](tutorials.html) : [__About us__](About_us.html)


### We are coming soon
__HRMAn__ enables you to automatically analyse parameters of host-pathogen interaction derived from immunofluorescent experiments. __HRMAn__ is a custom-built open-source analysis solution based on KNIME.

We have developed __HRMAn__ using *Toxoplasma gondii* and *Salmonella typhimurium* as proof of principle pathogens and we are planning to further expand the analysis software to work with more intracellular pathogens. __HRMAn__ analyses host killing of the pathogen, pathogen replication and host defence protein recognition of the pathogen. As input, __HRMAn__ can work with multiple images from high content image microscopes, as well as semi-automatic or manually acquired images from literally any fluorescence imaging platform.  

We are interested in further expanding __HRMAnâ€™s__ capabilities to other intracellular bacterial, parasitic or fungal pathogens. If you want to use __HRMAn__ and need our input, we are open to collaborate. If you are unable to use HRMAn with your imaging platform, we are also happy to help in resolving these issues. Please [contact](About_us.html) us to discuss aims and/ or problems.


HRMAn - Host Response to Microbe Analysis. The project is developing rapidly, stay tuned.
